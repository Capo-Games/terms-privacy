# Privacy

## Data We Collect

Rhythia is operated by CAPO GAMES and is built to collect as little data as possible.

We **do collect**:

- Internal **unique user IDs** (non-human-readable identifiers).
- Limited **gameplay and technical data** (e.g. scores, rankings, error logs, version info).
- Data strictly needed to run, secure, and improve the service under GDPR’s **legitimate interest** basis (where applicable).

We **do not collect**:

- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, payment data, or other traditional **PII**.
- Data for advertising, tracking across third-party sites, or selling to data brokers.

> Please do not include personal data in usernames, descriptions, or other UGC.

---

## GDPR, EU Users & Data Removal

- CAPO GAMES **does not operate in the European Union** and is therefore **not generally obligated** under GDPR to erase data for users **not originating from EU countries**.
- For users **originating from the EU/EEA**, and to the extent GDPR applies:
  - We will **remove or anonymize** their unique ID and all directly affiliated account data upon a valid erasure request.
  - This is subject to reasonable technical and legal limits.
- For **non-EU users**:
  - Data deletion requests are handled **at our discretion**.
  - There is **no GDPR obligation** for erasure for non-EU origin users.

---

## User-Generated Content (UGC) & Contact

When we process a valid erasure request:

- We **do remove/anonymize**:

  - The unique user ID associated with the account.
  - Account-linked gameplay/technical data tied to that ID (where feasible).

- We **do not automatically remove**:
  - **User-generated content (UGC)** such as beatmaps, levels, or other creations.
  - UGC may remain available to preserve game and community continuity.
  - Where possible, UGC is **detached from the user ID**, so it is no longer linked to a specific user.

For any privacy-related questions or data requests, please contact: **rhythiaa@gmail.com**.
